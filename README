Basic Puppet module for OpenSSH server.

Sample usage:

    node host1.fqdn {
        $ssh_port = 2222
        $ssh_pubkeyauthentication = yes
        $ssh_permitemptypasswords = no
        include openssh::server
    }

For Port, ListenAddress, HostKey and Subsystem it's possible to use multiple lines.
This can be configured as follows:

$ssh_port = [ "22", "2222" ]

Additional parameters can be found in templates/sshd_config.erb.
I've intentionally not used parameterized classes but I might change my mind about this later on.

It's been tested, but do let me know if anything breaks.
